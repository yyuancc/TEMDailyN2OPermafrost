# TEMDailyN2OPermafrost

1.TEM code

This folder contians the code for Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) to simulation N2O emission. 
The codes are written in C++ and need to be compiled under Linux environment. 
To compile, go to the code folder, run: mpiicpc xtem423e1.cpp -o xtem423e1
The interl and impi modules need to be loaded before compiling.

2.run example

This folder provides an example of running TEM for a small region. 
It includes data for simulating biophysical processes in northern high-latitude grids using specified forcing data and parameter files. 
Universal parameters are stored in the run/ folder, while spatially explicit inputs and parameters are organized in part-0/ and part-1/.

2.1 In part-0/ and part-1/, the files include:
This folder contains the input and parameterto run TEM. 
The entire dataset used to simulate northern high latitude N2O emission is not provided since it is too large. 
In stead, we give smaple input folders: part-0/ and part-1/.

climate inputs: 
each row represent for input for one year, and has 22 columns. These columns are:
longitude, latitude, variable name, grid cell land area (km2), year , total of Jan-Dec, maximum of Jan-Dec, mean of Jan-Dec, minimum of Jan-Dec, Jan-Dec (12 columns), and region. 
These inputs include:
	clds.txt-*: cloudiness in %.
	prec.txt-*: precipitation in mm.
	tair.txt-*: temperature in degree Â°C.
	vap.txt-*: vapor pressure in hPa.

spatially-explicit inputs:
	ph.txt-*: pH input. The columns are lon, lat, variable name, grid cell land area (km2), pH and region.
	elev.txt-*: elevation (m) input. The columns are lon, lat, variable name, elevation and region.
	clfao.txt-*: soil texture input. The columns are lon, lat, variable nuame, grid cell land area (km2), present of sand, silt and clay, source, region.
	veg.txt-*: vegetaiton class input. The columns are lon, lat, variable name, dummy, vegetation class, region, region.
        density.txt-*: Soil bulk density (g cm-3).The columns are lon, lat, variable name, soil bulk density and region.

Please note that although some inputs have grid cell land area column, this value is not used within TEM. 
Therefore, even the values do not match in different files, it won't influence the simulation results. 

2.2 Under run/ folder, there are parameter files universal to all grid cells.

kco21860.data: co2 concentration (ppm).
run.go4: input file list of TEM. 
QTLA44A2.ECD: soil thermal properties in each layer.
QTSP44A2.ECD: soil thermal properties not specified for layers.
QTST44A2.ECD: initial soil thermal profile. 
Tcomm423.ecd: information of vegetaion mosaic.
Tleaf423.ecd: leaf parameters.
Tmcrv423.ecd: mocrobial parameters, influencing soil decomposition, nitrogen cycle and N2O production.
Tpft423.ecd: the parameters describing the dominace of plant functional types under the control of WTD.
Tpftdecom.ecd: the parameters describing the litter decomposition rate of different plant functional types.
Trotz423.ecd: root parameters.
Tsoil423.ecd: soil density and hydrological parameters.
Tveg423_upland.ecd: vegetation parameters for peatlands.

2.3 How to run TEM

To run TEM, go to run/, make sure the intel and impi modules are loaded, and type in the command line:
mpirun -np $number_of_nodes ./xtem423e1 run.go4 tem4.log
If only running one part, then $number_of_nodes = 1. Similarly, to run 10 parts at the same time,  $number_of_nodes = 10. 
Please note that each part should be in a seperature folder named as part-n/. 
To run only part-1/ but not part-0/, change to first line of para_scd.go4 to 1. 
Similarly, to run part-1 to part-10, skipping part-0, also change the first line of para_scd.go4 to 1, and $number_of_nodes = 9.
In run.go4, line 75 is how many variables you want to output, ling 76-108 is the name of these variables, and line 109-141 is the name of output files. 
If you want to output other variables, change in these three sections accordingly. The order of output variables should match the order of output file names. 
The possible output variables are in ttem423e.cpp, line 39-374. For a line like:
strcpy(predstr[I_SOLC],"SOILORGC");  
The variable name in run.go4 should be SOILORGC
